### Project Overview
Businesses must categorise their customers based on how their products interact with their customers and use this information to apply marketing strategies which include customer retargeting, attribution-based marketing, targeting complementary products, and avoiding certain groups. 

This data analysis study attempts to provide insight into a superstore's consumer behavioural segmentation over a one-year period.  We want to obtain a better understanding of customer purchase activities and identify the customer segments that should be targeted or avoided. Further analysis is carried out to determine the behaviour of the consumer segment in relation to the discount.
