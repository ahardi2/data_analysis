### Project Overview
Businesses categorise their customers based on how their products interact with their customers and use this information to apply marketing strategies which include customer retargeting, attribution-based marketing, targeting complementary products, and avoiding certain groups. 

This data analysis study attempts to provide insight into a superstore's consumer behavioural segmentation over a one-year period.  The objective are to obtain a better understanding of customer purchase activities and identify the customer segments that should be targeted or avoided. Further analysis is carried out to determine the customer behaviour  in relation to the discount.

The analysis use The RFM analysis method. RFM which is based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of customer's purchase is a simple and powerful technique for producing the knowledge from customers data 


### Data Source
Superstore Dataset: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "superstore.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sales made by the company.


### Tools
The project use Python and jupyter notebook to perform data preparation, exploratory data analysis and data analysis


### Data Preparation
in this initial data preparation phase, we performed the folowing tasks
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data selection
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Customer Segmentation
This part produce a customer segments by performing the folowing tasks
1. calculate R, F, M values
2. calculate R, F, M scores
3. determine customers segments


### Data analysis
1. Descriptive analysis
2. analysis of the segment towards RFM values
3. analysis of the segments towards discount data
